# üöÄ Resources to Learn AI and Machine Learning

This repository contains a curated list of resources that helped me learn about artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks, and large language models (LLMs).

> **Personal Note:** This is my personal learning journey. While there may be other approaches to learning these topics, this path worked well for me and might be helpful for others too.

## üìö My Learning Path

- **[How I Use LLMs by Andrej Karpathy](https://youtu.be/EWvNQjAaOHw?si=mIKrh2bH6dsuePqO)**  
   A fantastic introduction to practical applications of large language models from one of the field's leading researchers. This video provides an excellent overview of what's possible with LLMs.

- **[Neural Networks Playlist by 3Blue1Brown](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&si=nOm2RqXWLgoOcgnC)**  
   Grant Sanderson's visual explanations make the mathematics behind neural networks intuitive and accessible. This series builds a solid foundation for understanding how neural networks work.

- **[Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning in a Day](https://youtu.be/Z_ikDlimN6A?si=iRbb6vOxC5QGyL3z)**  
   A comprehensive crash course on PyTorch fundamentals that gets you coding neural networks quickly. This hands-on approach helps solidify theoretical concepts.

- **[Practical Deep Learning for Coders by Jeremy Howard](https://course.fast.ai/)**  
   This course takes a top-down approach to deep learning, teaching you to build state-of-the-art models before diving into the theory. It's perfect for those who learn by doing.

- **[Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html)** by Andrej Karpathy  
   A course that builds neural networks from scratch, helping you understand the fundamentals deeply. Perfect for those who want to truly grasp how these systems work under the hood.
